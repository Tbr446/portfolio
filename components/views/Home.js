      <h1>Thanks for checking out my site! (A permanent WIP)</h1>
      <p>
        I'm an aspiring junior software engineer and this is where I will update
        my progress along the way. I'm a recent graduate of a full stack
        software development bootcamp called SavvvyCoders. With experience as a
        teammate and team leader, and a passion for learning, I am ready to hit
        the ground running as a new engineer.
