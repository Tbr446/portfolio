      <h1>Thanks for checking out my site! (A permanent WIP)</h1>
      <p>
        In January of 2022, I graduated from a full stack software development
        bootcamp called SavvyCoders. I am now an aspiring junior software
        engineer and this site is where I will showcase the things that I learn
        and the projects that I build along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please check back! This site will be undergoing changes on a daily
        basis.
